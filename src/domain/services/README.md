# SERVICE
> A service, also known as a provider, is another building block in Nest.js that is categorized under the separation of concerns principle.  
> It is designed to handle and abstract complex business logic away from the controller and return the appropriate responses.  
> All services in Nest.js are decorated with the **@Injectable()** decorator and this makes it easy to inject services into any other file, such as controllers and modules.
